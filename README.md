# Fake_News_Detection

This is a Project which detects if given news is fake. I have trained Scikit-Learn models of Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier and Random Forest Classifier to check best output possible and found Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier  giving most accurate predictions of the four.
