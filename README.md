# Fake_News_Detection

This is a Project which detects whether the given news is fake or not. I have used Scikit-Learn models of Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier and Random Forest Classifier to check best output possible and also trained the models and found Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier to be less overfitting to the training set and hence giving most accurate outputs of the four.
